# Weather-Forecast-with-Prophet

Prophet is an additive model method that forecasts time series data in which nonlinear patterns fit into the seasonality of the year, the week and regular, plus holiday impact. This works great for time series, which have clear seasonal effects and historical data for several seasons. Prophet efficiently manages the outliers and missed data and changes in the trend.

We will be using Prophet to make a forecast model based on four years of scraped weather data of California. We will evaluate the performance of our model by Cross-Validating with Prophet Diagnostics.
